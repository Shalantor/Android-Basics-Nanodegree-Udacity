# Design a Report Card Class

## Specifications

### Class Design
* __Constants__: Any constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices for constant values.
* __Submission Structure:__ The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, contained in a .zip file. 
* __Variables:__ The class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. The class does not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.
* __Constructor:__ The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class. 
* __Getters:__ Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them. 
* __Setters:__ All private variables require a setter method.
* __The toString() method:__ The class contains a toString() method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The toString() method should properly use the @Override notation.
